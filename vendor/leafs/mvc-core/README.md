Leaf MVC Core is the heart of Leaf MVC and serves as bridge between Leaf, modules and the MVC file structure. It provides a ton of extra functionality like extra globals, classes and methods that help with separation of concerns and building a full-blown MVC application with Leaf.

## üì¶ Installation

You can quickly get leaf mvc core up and running with the leaf cli

```sh
leaf install mvc-core
```

or with composer

```bash
composer require leafs/mvc-core
```

## üß© Components

MVC Core comes with:

- Controllers
- Database & Model functionalities
- Tons of MVC and module globals
- Autoloading directory files

Since you don't use this package on its own, the documentation is covered in the [Leaf MVC documentation](https://leafphp.dev/docs/mvc/).
